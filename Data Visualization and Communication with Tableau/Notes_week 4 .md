## Making Your Data Story Come Alive

1. The most useful story elements are characters, location or setting, conflict and resolution.

2. 1st way to draw your audience in is to describe the experience of a character/location related to your problem

3. 2nd way to engage your audience is to engage in actual conversation with them. 
You would do this by opening your presentation with questions. 
You could ask something like "if your parents over the age of 75, had a choice between reading a piece of physical mail or reading a blog on their phone, how many of them do you think would choose reading a blog on their phone?"

4. Use pictures that have people looking directly at you / that present the audience with a first view.
