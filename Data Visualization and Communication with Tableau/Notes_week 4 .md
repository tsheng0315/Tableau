## The Storyboarding Hourglass

## Big picture- detail- Big picture

1.Big picture

a. why your audience should care about the business problem you are about to solve.
compelling story elements,

2. Detail

a. present your recommendation in a S.M.A.R.T format. (Specific, Measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound.)

b. Summarize the main points you are going to use to support your recommendation

3. Big picture

a. how your data points support your smart recommendation

b. stating the strong benefits that will result if your recommendation is followed

c. reenergize the audience's enthusiasm and motivation by using story elements again

### Making Your Data Story Come Alive

1. The most useful story elements are characters, location or setting, conflict and resolution.

2. 1st way to draw your audience in is to describe the experience of a character/location related to your problem

3. 2nd way to engage your audience is to engage in actual conversation with them. 
You would do this by opening your presentation with questions. 
You could ask something like "if your parents over the age of 75, had a choice between reading a piece of physical mail or reading a blog on their phone, how many of them do you think would choose reading a blog on their phone?"

4. Use pictures that have people looking directly at you / that present the audience with a first view.

### Storyboarding Your Presentation

1. clarify the logic of your hypothesis and assertions.

2. have no more than three main story points. And each of those main story points should have no more than three sub-points

3. Make sure you show the data necessary for being convinced by an argument, either before or at the same time as making the argument

4. Sketching the graphs for each slide

5. People are more likely to be persuaded by an argument if you get them into a general feeling of agreement first

## Common Error

### Overgeneralization and Sample Bias

1. data set is small or highly biased

2. Have a lot of missing data in your data set

Solution: 
1. Always ask a lot of questions about how your data was collected

2. Always check how many data points you have in all the groups you're looking at3

3. If you do have a lot of data, split your full data set into three to five random subsets. See if you observe the same effects in each one as you see in the group as a whole

4. Before removing outliers or rows with some missing data from your analysis, examine whether there are any characteristics that seem common and or unique to those outliers or rows. If so, try to collect more data with those characteristics to fill in what you excluded.

### Misinterpretations Due to Lack of Controls

Include comparison groups that should not have the effect you were looking for in your analyses to make sure the effects you observe are due to the events.

### Correlation Does Not Equal Causation

1. Correlation refers to the phenomenon of two things having a tendency to vary together over multiple time points or multiple measurements.

2. Causation refers to the phenomenon of one thing happening as the result of the other thing.

3. A spurious relationship is when due to chance/ an unmeasured variable, but not by direct causality

### How Correlations Impact Business Decisions

1. AB testing

2. When you see a correlation, question whether there is some other variable that can explain the relationship you see.

3. Look for data that allows you to test whether that variable is a better measure of the phenomena you are interested in.

4. Examine whether the correlation found exists in other datasets. The more you can replicate the effect, the less likely the first correlation you saw was due to random chance

5. likelihood for getting into trouble increase as the complexity of your data sets increases as well

6. A correlation between two variables is consistent and reliable, one variable can be used to both measure and predict the other even if one doesn't cause the other

## Choosing Visualizations for Story Points

1. Bar charts or line charts are best.

2. Bar charts should be used for comparing measures in different groups or categories.

3. Bar charts are appropriate for most situations where you want to show aggregated rather than raw data, showing aggregated data is better.

4. Line charts are best for looking at how values and categories vary over time

5. Line charts also can show values along another type of variable

6. Line charts should be made into bar charts when the ticks on the x-axis don't a specific, inherent, sequential order.

7.

* Bar charts for comparing categories;

* Line charts for showing changes over time and sometimes changes over another ordered category, 

* Pie charts for conveying in general information about percentages when you are going to highlight four or fewer categorie
