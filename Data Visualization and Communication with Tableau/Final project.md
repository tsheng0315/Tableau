### Part 1
Define the problem: 

A consistent trend of drop off test rates

**Smart Goal**: 

Improve the completion rate of the first 20 test completed per subcriber by 10% over the next 5 months

Recommendation: 

* 1. Advertise to targeted cities(maybe these areas with high dog ownership and wealth (census data)) and use outdoor advertising in those areas

* 2. Implement Achievement such as badges that people can share on social media to keep subcribers engaged

* 3. Targeted Reminders (to Users at Specific Tests Where engagement drops the most) and offer promotions at those points

(Dognition could send a notification to play the next game at around 7pm)

* 4. Integrate info about local dog communities, training sessions, dog shows etc

* 5. Post actively on Instagram, and Facebook from the Dognition team with intersting tips, facts, or some cute pictures of 
dogs Friday through Monday.

* 6. Since the Majority of users are paying customers and not free users, offer some coupons for cooperated companies. /pay customers a small incentive, such as cash in and claim gifts.

* 7. Some sort of way to increase gamification... Puzzles to increase how smart your dog is and compete with others

Find out which breeds are more likely to want to undergo different tests and promote those ones through targeted advertising either on the site or on other online platforms.

* 8. Start with some cities to measure impact(A/B test)

### Data Analysis of Dognition 

## Coursework Facts from our data analysis 

* About 1 in 4 dogs complete 20 or more games 

* Customers play the most Dognition Games on Sunday's

* Customers play the most amount of games at 7pm

* The US by far has the highest amount of Dognition customers. California being the state with highest population of users is a
market of high importance that cannot be overlooked.

* Publicity did work in Oct 2014. Dognition was featured on "60 minuetes"

* The "Free Start" promotion didn't work. less than 6% of the users finshed it

* The story behind the drop off rates reveal three trends: Occur when a subcategory test is completed rather than when a subcategory
test is still in progress.

* Empathy --> Communication --> Cunning Bar charts clearly reveal a downward drop off trend. 

* The drop off rate after test 20 reveals That The Complexity and Technicality of the games is so high that it discourages the users to
continue on. 


For users subscribe Dognition’s service, they and their dogs can play 20 interactive games by sequence and then get an in-depth analysis report about your dogs’ characteristics. But according to the analysis of Dognition data, most users only finish the Empathy category of total tests and stop playing the game.

1. The main problem may be the game design：the Communication subcategory games may be a little difficult for the dogs so that they cannot finish the tasks.

2. The games are not attractive and users grandately lost their interest. 

For free start: 

Dognition tried to offer a “Free Start” promotion that gives the customers the first four tests for free.
Hoping that once potential customers get a chance to experience the product, they will be more likely to buy a subscription. 
But from the below chart we can see that Free Start users dropped more after the fourth game than No Free Start users. 
So this promotion strategy is not effective as expected.

Dognition may use reminder emails and online advertisement as alternative promotion strategies. 
From the charts, most users play the games during the beginning of a week and the after-work period (05:00pm-20:00pm); 
Users are mainly located in United States and from California, North Carolina and New York, Texas and Florida.

In conclusion, Dognition should re-design the tests because the difficulty and sequence of the games may not be comfortable and interesting for current users. “Free Start” promotion can be cancelled due to lack of effectiveness. 
To attract new users and secure existing users, Dognition can invest in advertising emails;
