### Part 1
Define the problem: 

A consistent trend of drop off test rates

**Smart Goal**: 

Improve the completion rate of the first 20 test completed per subcriber by 10% over the next 3 months

Recommendation: 

* 1. Advertise to targeted cities(maybe these areas with high dog ownership and wealth (census data)) and use outdoor advertising in those areas

* 2. Implement Achievement such as badges that people can share on social media to keep subcribers engaged

* 3. Targeted Reminders (to Users at Specific Tests Where engagement drops the most) and offer promotions at those points

(Dognition could send a notification to play the next game at around 7pm)

* 4. Integrate info about local dog communities, training sessions, dog shows etc

* 5. Post actively on Instagram, and Facebook from the Dognition team with intersting tips, facts, or some cute pictures of 
dogs Friday through Monday.

* 6. Since the Majority of users are paying customers and not free users, offer some coupons for cooperated companies. /pay customers a small incentive, such as cash in and claim gifts.

* 7. Some sort of way to increase gamification... Puzzles to increase how smart your dog is and compete with others

Find out which breeds are more likely to want to undergo different tests and promote those ones through targeted advertising either on the site or on other online platforms.

* 8. Start with some cities to measure impact(A/B test)
